# Hi there 👋

## I'm Filipe, here are a few things about me:

- I’m a **Software Tester**, a **Developer**, a **Husband**, a **life-long Learner** and **Open-source software lover** & **contributor**.
- I’m interested in solving Test problems through context-driven approaches, developing accessible test tooling and studying large scale software systems from a performance testing and security perspective.
- I’m currently working with [Kong](https://konghq.com) as a Staff Test Engineer on the [Insomnia](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia) team. You can find my resume [here](https://filfreire.com/cv.pdf).

## Other curiosities:
- I was given the 🏅 **(Thinking) Tester of the year** award 🏅 of the [Jerry Weinberg Testing Excellence Awards 2021](https://teatimewithtesters.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TTwT_December_2021.pdf) in December 2021.
- I've completed the following [Rapid Software Testing (RST)](https://rapid-software-testing.com/) trainings: 
  - [RST Managed](https://rapid-software-testing.com/rst-managed/), August 2020; 
  - [RST Explored](https://rapid-software-testing.com/rst-explored/), December 2019; 
  - [RST Applied](https://rapid-software-testing.com/rst-applied/), August 2017
- Since late 2018 I started documenting and improving my personal work methodology, **Raid Software Testing** which is a “guerrilla” work methodology for software testers in “monster” projects (read more [in my post about RaidST](https://filfreire.com/posts/asymmetric_warfare)).
